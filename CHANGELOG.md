## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- **The status line says when a newer release is out, and `tezgah update`
  takes it.** A `↑X.Y.Z` chip sits beside the logo on every surface. A redraw
  reads a cached answer, and a detached check refreshes it at most once a day.
  `tezgah update [--dry-run]` updates through the channel the install came
  from (release prefix, Homebrew, npm or git) and re-arms the hosts. The
  `update-check-off` switch turns the check and the chip off.

### Fixed

- **The Homebrew formula runs.** It copied `tezgah-setup` out of the tree, so
  the copy could not find `hooks/` and died on import. It now links into the
  installed tree, and also installs the command as `tezgah`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- First public release.
